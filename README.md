# 📬 SMS Spam Detection Project

 **A Machine Learning project to detect spam messages using text classification techniques.**

## 🧩 About the Project
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model that can automatically classify incoming SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam).
We use a labeled dataset containing real-world SMS messages and apply text processing techniques to train various machine learning models for classification.
The aim is to reduce unwanted messages and improve user experience.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Text Tokenization, Stopwords Removal, and Stemming  
✅ Feature Extraction (Bag of Words, TF-IDF)  
✅ Model Training (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)  
✅ Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)  
✅ Final Model Selection  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** (for data handling)
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **NLTK** (for natural language processing)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms)

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **high accuracy** with Naive Bayes model.
- Built a reliable SMS Spam Detection.
- Ready for deployment into web apps.
